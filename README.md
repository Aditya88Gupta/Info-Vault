#### Introduction


<div align="center"> Discussion of new ideas and sharing of knowledge is a prominent part of learning and hence

one of the most important ingredients for academic progress. It helps students to process the

information that is being taught and stimulates practical and reflexive thinking.

Students who explore a new field of study being part of a peer group have shown much more

motivation and enthusiasm while learning new concepts and are therefore more likely to be

successful in learning achievement. Being part of a study group and having a platform to

exchange/discuss ideas not only helps in academic excellence but also helps one build his soft

skills and trains one in self-expression.
  

Under normal circumstances, students had ample opportunities to interact and discuss doubts,

exchange ideas, debate on topics, and talk about subjects/interests. But, given the current

pandemic situation, it has been difficult for students to connect, share ideas, interact with

teachers, and discuss doubts. The only interaction time available to students is during online

classes, where the majority portion of time is utilized for teaching new concepts. Also, due to the

lack of an adequate platform where students could exchange ideas, there is has been a very

minimal scope of discussion outside of the virtual classroom. As a result, not only the time

available for discussion been significantly cut short but also there is no appropriate platform

where students could interact and discuss outside of their regular classes.

Of course, there are third-party questions and answer websites like Quora, StackOverflow but

they are not precisely designed for a student of our college. These websites are a portal for

discussion on topics of computer science and mathematics, which could range from a beginner

to an advanced level. This humongous amount of information could prove to be overwhelming,

especially for students new to the field of computer science. As a result, students are often

reluctant to use these platforms for discussions.
  

With Info Vault, we aim to provide the students of our college the platform they need to ask their

doubts, inquire about topics, and share knowledge. Info Vault will be a question and answer

portal especially designed for a student of our college, where he/she could interact with their

respective faculty, ask doubts, exchange ideas, and move towards academic achievement. </div>



#### Problem Statement

<div align="center"> Due to the pandemic, we have been forced to switch to online learning, the methods during

which the interaction level of students has decreased, as on-campus they had ample

opportunities to interact, discuss and talk about the subjects of their choice but due to the

complete online medium it has become difficult to connect and socialize. Also, there is an

absence of an adequate platform where students could interact with each other, ask their

queries, and even solve otherâ€™s queries to help their fellow.

Given the current circumstances, it has been difficult for the student to become more aware and

explore different domains except for their course subjects.</div>


#### Objective


<div align="center"> Given the importance of discussion and interaction in learning, it is paramount that students of

our college have accessibility to a platform that would allow them to host a discussion/debate.

Our goal with "Info Vault" is to provide the students of our college the platform they need to ask

their doubts, inquire about topics, and share knowledge. With Info Vault we aim to combine the

features of various web portals like StackOverflow and Quora and precisely design a platform

for a student of Bennett. We hope that a question and answer portal relevant to students of our

college would help them move towards better learning achievement. </div>
  

#### Proposed System
  

<div align="center"> Info Vault will be a web portal for discussion, specially designed for the students of Bennett

University, where students can not only discuss doubts and exchange ideas but also interact

with their teaching staff and inquire about topics being taught in class. With Info Vault, we aim to

provide the students of our college, the platform they need to ask their doubts, inquire about

topics, and share their knowledge.

At Info Vault, students will be able to ask questions and tag their respective faculty from whom

they expect an answer. They will be able to post questions and categorize them under the

different subsections of the vast field of computer science. Info Vault will allow students to host

discussions and share their knowledge with their peers. This platform will not only promote

discussion but also help students improve their social skills and connect with their peers having

similar interests and goals, which will, in turn, prove to beneficial for all.



Info Vault will not only improve the learning achievement of students of our college but will also

enhance the teaching experience for the faculty. At Info Vault, the teaching staff could keep

track of the topics from which the bulk of the doubts have occurred. This recognition could, later

on, prove to be useful to organize revision classes and discussions.

We hope that Info Vault will be a platform that would bring about a change in the current system

of education and would prove to be a portal where students could learn from one another and

move towards academic excellence.</div>
